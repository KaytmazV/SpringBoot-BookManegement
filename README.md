# SpringBoot-BookManegement
The Book Management project is a RESTful API for managing books using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and Hibernate. It supports CRUD operations, enabling users to add, update, delete, and retrieve books. Spring Data JPA simplifies database interactions, while Hibernate maps Java objects to tables. The project is built using MySQL as the database.
